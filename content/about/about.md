Doing programming since the 80s, I still see stuff that I would like to work which doesn't.
With all the LLMs in the world, programming is still fun, and I like to tinker around.
While waiting to be able to put my blog on [fledger](./projects/fledger), I finally started my
blog here using hugo.
I'll write about my latest experiments in IT, and will probably also link to my professional
articles I'm writing.
Being a nerd means to me that, even though I'm paid for doing IT stuff, I continue doing more IT
stuff afterworks.
Even more so, now that I have some responsibilities which have nothing to do with programming...

Besides programming, I like running (finished 1 out of 3 marathons), playing the Saxophone at Church,
hoping that capitalism will be kept at bay by democracy, and working on cryptography.
